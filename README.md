# AI-Consistency-improvement-final-year-project
This repository contains the code and resources for the Consistency Improvement in AI-Generated Content project, which focuses on detecting and enhancing the factual and linguistic consistency of AI-generated content. The project leverages advanced machine learning models and frameworks to analyze and improve the reliability of AI outputs.

# Project Overview
The primary objectives of this project are:

1. To install and configure the necessary libraries and dependencies.
2. To download, preprocess, and manage datasets relevant to consistency analysis.
3. To implement algorithms and models for detecting inconsistencies in AI-generated text.
4. To develop methods for improving the consistency and reliability of AI-generated content.

# Key Components

1. Installation of Required Libraries: Scripts and instructions for setting up the project environment and installing dependencies.
2. Dataset Handling: Code for downloading, extracting, and preprocessing datasets used in the project.
3. Consistency Detection: Implementation of models and algorithms to detect inconsistencies in AI-generated content.
4. Consistency Improvement: Techniques and methods to enhance the consistency of AI-generated text.

# Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FYP_Consistency_Improvement.git
2. Install the required libraries: Detailed in the notebook and requirements.txt file.
3. Download and preprocess the datasets as demonstrated in the notebook.
4. Run the provided scripts and notebooks to explore and improve AI-generated content consistency.
